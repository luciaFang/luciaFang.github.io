                <p class="one-of-the-biggest-c valign-text-middle">
                  One of the biggest challenges in sign language translation is the lack of technology supporting
                  translation between different regions. To address this issue, under the supervision of my mentor, we
                  have developed a no-code web interface for a state-of-the-art hand tracking algorithm called
                  Mediapipe, which can track hands in videos with high accuracy. To further enhance our approach, we
                  have developed a new method to track time points with corresponding 3D hand poses. Building on our
                  progress from last semester, I am currently collecting more American, Spanish, and Chinese sign
                  language videos. Our goal is to build a supervised Convolutional Neural Network that can read
                  finger-spelling for each language. To facilitate sign translation across languages, we will leverage
                  the Google Translate API, followed by text to image reconstruction to provide a more intuitive sign
                  language translation. Our project has the potential to make a significant impact in improving
                  accessibility and communication for the deaf and hard of hearing community.

                The purpose of the research was to develop a system capable of recognizing American Sign language
                <br />(ASL) finger-spelling in real time. People who are deaf or hard of hearing use finger-spelling to
                <br />communicate, in which each letter of the alphabet is represented by a unique hand gesture.
                <br />In our pipeline, video input of a person’s finger-spelling is analyzed using machine learning
                algorithms, <br />and the corresponding letters are outputted in real-time, enabling people who use
                finger-spelling to<br />
                communicate with others who are unfamiliar with the gestures. Our pipeline can facilitate
                <br />communication and improve the lives of people who are deaf or hard of hearing by decoding
                <br />finger-spelling in real time.

            <p class="our-research-utilize valign-text-middle">
              Our research utilized a video of a person finger spelling to extract 3D pose information through
              Mediapipe. Theextraction allowed us to determine which letters were being represented and how the hand
              pose changed over time.The plotted 3D coordinates of 24 out of the 26 letters as well as ”background” of
              the alphabet provide a visualrepresentation of the extracted data (Fig. 2a), which can be used to analyze
              and improve the finger-spelling de-coding algorithm’s accuracy. By using the plotted 3D coordinates as a
              ”reduced” set of features, we can develop afinger-spelling classifier for American Sign Language (ASL).
              This approach generalizes across different hand sizes,video resolutions, camera angles, and backgrounds.
              The classifier’s versatility enables accurate decoding of finger-spelling in various situations, making it
              a more useful tool

                      Additionally, we leveraged the 3D pose generated from Mediapipe to enable a convolution neural
                      network to learn the signed alphabet from the hand pose images. The network achieved a validation

                    information will be passed through our trained convolution neural network, which will output the
                    corresponding English alphabet. By stacking these alphabets and segmenting them with 1-2 seconds of
                    background classification, we will construct English words and formulate a sentence. Once the
                    sentence is complete, the app will translate the text into the language of the user&#39;s choice. To
                    complete the communication loop, we will add text-to-speech functionality. </span
